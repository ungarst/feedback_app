	<p>It appears that you are attempting to assign to something that is not a variable.</p>

	<p>Make sure that on the left hand side of an equals sign (the assignment operator) you have a variable.  The value of the expression on the right hand side will then be assigned, or stored, in this variable.</p>


	<div class="example">

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int a, b;
a + b = 10;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int a, b;
b = 100;
a = b + 10;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>The equals sign is the assignment operator, and so the left hand side of the equals sign must be a variable, not an expression.</p>

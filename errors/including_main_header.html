<div class="feedback">

	<p>You are writing a lot of code there!  You have actually included the header for the main method:</p>

<div style = "margin: 20px;">
	<p style="font-family: courier; font-size: 120%; color: #000;">
		<span style = "background-color: #ffff99; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #cc0;">
		<LINE>
		</span>
	</p>
</div>

	<p>This is not needed â€“ CodeWrite automatically wraps the code that you write into a class with a main method.  All you need to do is complete the body of the method.</p>

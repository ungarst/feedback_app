	<p>It looks like you are using an illegal operator in one of your boolean expressions.</p>

	<p>Operators in boolean expressions that are often used incorrectly include:</p>
	<ul>

				<li>=! - The exclamation mark should be before the equals sign</li>
				<li>=> - The greater than sign should come before the equals sign</li>
				<li>=< - The less than sign should come before the equals sign</li>
				<li><< - This is the left bitwise shift, not much less than</li>
				<li>>> - This is the right bitwise shift, not much greater than</li>
				<li>\\ - Remember, if you are trying to have your if based on one condition OR an other, you need to use ||</li>
	</ul>

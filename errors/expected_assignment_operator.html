	<p>You are probably missing an operator in your code:</p>

	<p>A lot of the time, this could just be a missing assignment operator (i.e. the equals sign), but it can also be other operators like +, -, /, *, %, || and &&.</p>

	<p>If you are trying to assign a value to a variable, then you should use the assignment operator (i.e. put an “=” sign after the variable name and before the value).</p>

	<p>Otherwise, use the appropriate arithmetic operator (+, -, /, *, %) if you are calculating something, the appropriate boolean operator (||, &&) if you are combining logical expressions, or the comparison operator (==) is you are comparing two values.</p>

					<p>Inserting an equals sign manages to fix most of these errors as they are assignments to a variable.</p>

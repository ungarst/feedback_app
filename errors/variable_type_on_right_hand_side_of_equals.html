	<p>It appears that when initializing one of your variables you have included the variable type on the right hand side of the equals sign.</p>

	<p>You don't need to do this as Java can automatically determine the correct type of the expression on the right hand side.  Remove the variable type from the right hand side of the equals sign and try again.</p>

	<div class="example">

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int a = int 7; </pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int a = 7; </pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>We don't need to include the type (i.e. int) in front of the 7</p>

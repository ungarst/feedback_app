	<p>It appears there are too many closing curly braces in your code..</p>

	<p>Note that the opening and the closing curly brace for the method are already provided for you by CodeWrite – so make sure that you haven’t put a closing curly brace at the end of your code to close the method.</p>

	<p>If that’s not the case, then try to find the misbalance of opening curly brackets to closing curly brackets and delete the extra closing curly bracket.</p>

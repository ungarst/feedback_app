	<p>It looks like you have tried to call a method, but you have included the types of the inputs in the method call.</p>

	<p>It is unnecessary to do this, as Java already knows what type the inputs are from the definition of the method you are calling.  Remove the variable types from in front of the inputs in the method call and try again.</p>

	<div class="example">

		<table>

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>String word = "Programming";
int position = 4;
char end = word.charAt(int position);</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>String word = "Programming";
int position = 4;
char end = word.charAt(position);</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>We don't need to specify that position is an int in the call to charAt().</p>

	<p>It seems like one of the lines in your code is missing a closing parenthesis.</p>

	<p>Remember, every opening parenthesis must be matched with a closing parenthesis.</p>

	<p>Have a look at your code and ensure that all your brackets are matched, then try run your code again.</p>

	<div class="example">

		<table>

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int a, b, c, d;
a = 5;
b = 10;
c = 7;

d = ((a + b) + c;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int a, b, c, d;
a = 5;
b = 10;
c = 7;

d = ((a + b) + c;)</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>The last line has more opening parentheisis than closing parenthesis and so needs a closing parenthesis at the end to finish the line.</p>

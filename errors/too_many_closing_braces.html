<div class="feedback">

	<p>It seems like one of the lines in your code has an extra closing parenthesis.</p>

	<div style = "margin: 20px;">
	<p style="font-family: courier; font-size: 120%; color: #000;">
		<span style = "background-color: #ffff99; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #cc0;">
		<LINE>
		</span>
	</p>
	</div>


	<p>Remember, every opening parenthesis must be matched with a closing parenthesis. This could be due to you accidentally including an extra closing parenthesis or forgetting to include an opening parenthesis.</p>

	<p>Have a look at your code and ensure that all your brackets are matched, then try run your code again.</p>

	<div class="example">

		<table>

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>a = (b + c) + d);</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>a = (b + c) + d;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>Incorrect code has more closing parentheses than it does opening. Removing the last closing parenthesis means that we have the same amount of opening parentheses as closing.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>

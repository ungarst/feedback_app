<p>Apparently some of the code that you have written is unreachable, and so won't compile. What a waste! The first line of unreachable code is:</p>

<p style="font-family: courier; font-size: 120%; color: #000;">
	<span style = "background-color: #ffff99; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #cc0;">
	<LINE>
	</span>
</p>

<p>Unreachable code is when some of the code that you wrote can never be executed because there is no path that leads to it.</p>
<p>This is generally when you have code following a return statement within a block (e.g. an if statement)</p>

				<th>Correct Code</th>

			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int a = 5;
int b = 10;

if (a > b) {
	return false;
	a += b; 
}

return true;</pre>

<pre>int a = 5;

	a += b;
	return false;
}

return true;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>The <code>a += b</code> line can never be executed as the method returns before it is reached. By moving it above the return statement then the line will be executed before the method returns.</p>

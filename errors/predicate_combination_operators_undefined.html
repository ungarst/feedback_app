	<p>It appears you are incorrectly using one or more of the following operators in your code:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&&</li>
		<li>||</li>
		<li>!</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Both the && operator and the || operator can only appear between two boolean values.  The ! operator can only appear to the left of a boolean value.</p>
	
	<p>Most occurrences of this error are caused by incorrectly formed boolean expressions (for example, in the condition of an if statement).</p>

				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>double items = 100.0/9.0;

<pre>double items = 100.0/9.0;

	return false;
}</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>The code on the left is incorrect because the ! operator can only appear to the left of an expression of boolean type (but 0 is of type int).   In addition, the && operator can only appear between two expressions of type Boolean.</p>

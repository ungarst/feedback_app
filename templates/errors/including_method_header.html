	<p>It looks like your code was unable to compile. Lets take a look why...</p>

	<p>It appears you included the method header with the code you submitted.</p>

	<p>When you submit your code, CodeWrite wraps what you write in a method header and puts it a class so that it can be tested. This means that there will be two method headers for the one method header</p>

	<p>Try removing the method header from the code you have written and submit again.</p>

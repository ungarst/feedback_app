<p>It looks like your code was unable to compile. Lets take a look why...</p>

<p>It appears you included the header for the main method in the code you submitted.</p>

<p>CodeWrite automatically wraps the code that you write into a class so you don't have to include any class or method headers.</p>

<p>Try removing the main method from your code and try it again.</p>

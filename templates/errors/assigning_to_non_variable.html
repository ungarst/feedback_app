	<p>It appears that you are attempting to assign to something that is not a varible.</p>

	<p>Java requires you to assign to a variable so that it knows where to store the result of your expression.</p>

	<p>To fix this, make sure that everything on the left and side of an equals sign is a variable. It may mean that you have to write a few more lines, but it will mean that your program will compile.</p>


	<div class="example">

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>String word = "programming";
int position = 6;
char replacement = 'z';
word.charAt(postion) = replacement;
return word;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>String word = "programming";
int position = 6;
char replacement = 'z';
char[] chars = word.toCharArray(); 
chars[6] = replacement; 
return String.valueOf(chars);</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>word.charAt(position) is not a variable so we cannot assign to it. To assign to a single character we need to break the word up into a char array. Each element in the char array is a variable so we can assign to it, then we turn it back into a string.</p>

	<p>It appears your error is having a comma either directly after an opening brace or directly before a closing bracket.</p>

	<p>Either this is a typo, or you are using it to try and skip some parameters in a method, which Java doesn't allow you to do. Try searching the method in google to see if there is a way to avoid entering that parameter.</p>

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>

			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int x = someMethod(,10); </pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int x = someMethod(10);</pre>

					<p>Delete the comma to get rid of this error</p>

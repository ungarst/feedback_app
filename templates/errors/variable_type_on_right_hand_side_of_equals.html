	<p>It appears that when initializing one of your variables you are including variable type on the right hand side of the equals sign.</p>

	<p>You don't need to do this as Java already knows if this is the right type of variable or not.</p>

	<p>Remove the variable type from the right hand side of the equals sign and try run your code again. </p>

	<div class="example">

<pre>int a = int 7; </pre>

				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int a = 7; </pre>

				<td class="explanation">
					<p>We don't need variable type in front of the 7</p>

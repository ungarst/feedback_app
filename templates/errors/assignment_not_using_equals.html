	<p>It appears that you are trying to assign to a variable incorrectly, and are somehow missing, or incorrectly using an equals sign.</p>

	<p>Remember, variable assignment should look like <span class="code-sample">variableName = value;</span> (you will also need to put the variable type infront of the varible name if you haven't already declared it).</p>

	<div class="example">

		<table>

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int x = 5;	
int a 10; 
/* Need to give the boolean variable a name so 
	we are assinging to something */
boolean x == 10;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int x = 5;
int a = 10;
boolean b = (x == 10);</pre>

				<td class="explanation">
					<p>On the second line we need to insert an equals sign so we are assigning 10 to a. On the third line we need to give the boolean a name so we are assigning to something.</p>

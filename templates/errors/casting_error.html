	<p>It appears your code caused a casting error when we were compiling it for you. Casting errors occur when you try and cast an object to a type it can't be casted to (e.g. casting a string to an int).</p>

	<p>Ensure that your variables are able to be casted from one type to another and try run your code again.</p>

	<div class="example">

		<table>

			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int x;
String s = "Hello, World!";
x = (int) s;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int x;
double d = 34.92;
x = (int) d;</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>Strings cannot be casted to an integer, so the incorrect code cannot compile. Doubles can be casted to integers (although some precision is lost) so the correct code can compile.</p>

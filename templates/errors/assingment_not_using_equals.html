<p>It looks like your code was unable to compile. Lets take a look why...</p>

<p>It appears that you are trying to assign to a variable incorrectly, and are somehow missing, or incorrectly using an equals sign.</p>

<p>Remember, variable assignment should look like <code>variableName = value;</code> (you will also need to put the variable type infront of the varible name if you haven't already declared it).</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>Incorrect Code</p>
<code><pre>
int x = 5;
int a 10; // Need to insert an equals sign so we are assigning 10 to a
boolean x == 10; // Need to give the boolean variable a name so we are assinging to something
</pre></code>

<p>Correct Code</p>
<code><pre>
int x = 5;
int a = 10;
boolean b = (x == 10);
</pre></code>

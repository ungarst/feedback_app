	<p>It appears you are trying to call a library method that does not exist.</p>
	<p>Library methods are methods that exist in java.lang, where the Math and String classes are found.</p>

	<p>Ensure that the spelling of the method is correct. Java cannot tell if the method is spelt incorrectly, and will think it does not exist regardless.</p>
	<p>If you are sure that the spelling is correct then the method may not exist. Try Google-ing the method to see you have the inputs right or the method actually exists.</p>

				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int a = Math.max(1, 5); // max is spelt correctly now
int b = Math.min(Math.min(1,2), 3); // Have made min only take 2 arguments each time it is called
boolean c; // We have written the logic for isPositive ourselves

					<p>max has been spelt incorrectly<br />min only takes in 2 parameters but we have given it 3<br />isPositive(int x) is not defined in Math, and you may have to write the logic for it yourself</p>

	<p>It appears that you are misusing the <code>new</code> keyword. The new keyword is reserved for the construction of new objects.</p>

	<p>If you are attempting to call one of your variables new then this is most likely where this error is coming from.</p>

	<p>If you are not trying to call a variable new then you are attempting to construct an object incorrectly.</p>

	<p>Object construction is done by calling <code>new ObjectType (parameters)</code> and the object must be assigned to a variable or used in a method call. If the object's constructor doesn't take any parameters then you still need to include empty parenthesis.</p>

					<p>The first misuse of new is because we cannot call a variable 'new'. </br>When declaring the variable 'first' we don't need to put 'new' before the object type on the left hand side of the assignment. </br>When creating objects we need to include the parameters to the objects constructor.</p>

<p>It looks like your code was unable to compile. Lets take a look why...</p>

<p>It appears that when you were declaring your variables you wrapped the variable type in parenthesis, which you don't need to know.</p>

<p>Remove the parenthesis from around the variable type and try run your code again. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Incorrect Code</p>
<code><pre>
(int) i = 50;
(String) s = "Hello";
</pre></code>

<p>Correct Code</p>
<code><pre>
int i = 50;
String s = "Hello";
</pre></code>

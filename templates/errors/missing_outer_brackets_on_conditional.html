<p>It looks like your code was unable to compile. Lets take a look why...</p>

<p>It appears your code is generating an OnlySynchronized error. This is generally due to a syntax error in an if statement.</p>

<p>If you want to combine booleans in an if statement using <code>&&</code> or <code>||</code> then you need to make sure that the entire conditional is wrapped in brackets, as well as each individual boolean condition if you choose to put them in brackets.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Incorrect Code</p>
<code><pre>
double items = 9.4;
int a = 6;

if (items >10) && (a == 0) {
	return true;
}
</pre></code>

<p>Correct Code</p>
<code><pre>
double items = 9.4;
int a = 6;

if ((items >10) && (a == 0)) {
	return true;
}
</pre></code>

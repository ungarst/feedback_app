	<p>It appears that you are attempting to use square brackets on a variable that is not an array.</p>

	<p>Square braces are used for accessing elements, and so can only be used on variables of type array</p>

	<p class="code-sample">int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};</br> int second = a[1];</p>

	<p>Many people encounter this error when trying to look at a single character from a String.</p>

	<p>Although accessing strings using square brackets works in some languages, it doesn't in Java</p>

	<p>If you want to access a single character from a string in Java, use the .charAt(int index) method.</p>

	<div class="example">


		<table>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>String s = "I love using CodeWrite";
char secondCharacter = s[1];</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>String s = "I love using CodeWrite";
char secondCharacter = s.charAt(1); </pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>The incorrect code is trying to access the second character incorrectly using array style accessing. Instead, you should use the .charAt(int index) method */ </p>

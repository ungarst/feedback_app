<p>It looks like your code was unable to compile. Lets take a look why...</p>

<p>It seems like one of the lines in your code has an extra closing parenthesis.</p>

<p>Remember, every opening parenthesis must be matched with a closing parenthesis. This could be due to you accidentally including an extra closing parenthesis or forgetting to include an opening parenthesis.</p>

<p>Have a look at your code and ensure that all your brackets are matched, then try run your code again.</p>


<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Incorrect Code</p>
<code><pre>
String word = "Programming";

char firstLetter = word.charAt(0);
char secondLetter = word.charAt(word.length()-1);

String newWord = (secondLetter + word.substring(word.length())+firstLetter));
return newWord;
</pre></code>

<p>Correct Code</p>
<code><pre>
String word = "Programming";

char firstLetter = word.charAt(0);
char secondLetter = word.charAt(word.length()-1);

String newWord = (secondLetter + word.substring(word.length())+firstLetter);
return newWord;
</pre></code>

<p>Your code was unable to compile this time. Lets take a look why...</p>

<p>It seems like one of the lines in your code is missing a closing parenthesis.</p>

<p>Remember, every opening parenthesis must be matched with a closing parenthesis.</p>

<p>Have a look at your code and ensure that all your brackets are matched, then try run your code again.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Incorrect Code</p>
<code><pre>
String word = "Programming";

char firstLetter = word.charAt(0);
char secondLetter = word.charAt(word.length()-1);

String newWord = (secondLetter + word.substring(word.length())+firstLetter;
return newWord;
</pre></code>

<p>Correct Code</p>
<code><pre>
String word = "Programming";

char firstLetter = word.charAt(0);
char secondLetter = word.charAt(word.length()-1);

String newWord = (secondLetter + word.substring(word.length())+firstLetter);
return newWord;

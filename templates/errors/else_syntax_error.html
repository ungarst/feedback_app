	<p>It appears that one of your if statements is written incorrectly. Lets quickly revise the correct structure of an if statement</p>

	<pre>if (condition) { 
		// Statements
	} else if (condition) { 
		// Statements
	} else { 
		// Statements
	}</pre>

	<p>The most likely cause of you error is having a semicolon after the if condition (see the example for a full explanation).</p>

	<p>Ensure that all your if statements are written correctly and then try run your code again.</p>

	<div class="example">

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th>Incorrect Code</th>
				<th>Correct Code</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="eHeader"><p>Example</p></td>
				<td class="incorrectCode">
<pre>int c = 4;
if (c > 6); { 
	return true;
} else { 
	return false;
}</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="correctCode">
<pre>int c = 4;
if (c > 6) {
	return true;
} else { 
	return false;
}</pre>
				</td>
				<td class="explanation">
					<p>The semicolon after the if statement finishes the conditional area, and so all code after it will be executed regardless. The following opening curly brace opens a new block of code, which will always be executed. When it reaches the matching closing curly brace, the block of code is completed and execution will continue. The program then reaches the else condition, but it isn't preceeded by an if statement. As all else statementsneed to be preceeded by an if statement, Java throws an error.</p>
